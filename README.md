# Winnie Track

WinneTrack is an open source package that will provide live device tracking functionality for appliations. It will include functionality to enable device tracking on a device and will sync that information to a real time database on Firebase. This information will then be used on the other side to allow the app to display live tracking information on a map. It will not include the map functionality and only the real time stream of the location information from the device being tracked.
